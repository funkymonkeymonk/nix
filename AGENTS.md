- **Maintain awareness of current project state and conventions**
- **Adapt to evolving project requirements and standards**
- **Support multiple development workflows and methodologies**

## Environment and Setup

### Prerequisites
- No additional environment setup required beyond the existing 1Password CLI integration
- The assistant automatically inherits the project's development environment through `task opencode`

### Project-Specific Context
opencode acknowledges awareness of:
- **Taskfile Format**: Common operations are defined using [Taskfile.dev](https://taskfile.dev/) format in `Taskfile.yml`
- **Nix Ecosystem**: Integration with nix-darwin and home-manager configurations
- **Key Documentation References**:
  - [home-manager options](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml)
  - [nix-darwin manual](https://nix-darwin.github.io/nix-darwin/manual/index.html)

## Usage Instructions and Best Practices

### Activation Protocol
To initiate opencode services:
```bash
task opencode
```
This command automatically handles 1Password authentication and launches opencode with the appropriate environment.

### Operational Guidelines
The User agrees to:
1. **Provide context** about the specific system or configuration being worked on
2. **Specify the scope** of changes (e.g., "update home-manager config for user X" vs "refactor entire flake")
3. **Review all suggestions** before implementation
4. **Test changes** in a safe environment before applying to production systems
5. **Document decisions** for future reference and team knowledge sharing

## Reusability and Adaptation

### Cross-Repository Compatibility
This contract is designed to be adaptable for use in other repositories. To customize for different projects:

1. **Update project-specific sections**:
   - Replace Nix-specific references with your project's technology stack
   - Modify task runner references (Taskfile.yml â†’ Makefile, package.json scripts, etc.)
   - Update documentation links to match your project's tools

2. **Customize safety guidelines** based on your project's risk profile and compliance requirements

3. **Adjust communication preferences** to match team preferences and project complexity

4. **Update integration points** to match your CI/CD, testing, and deployment workflows

This modular approach ensures the agent configuration remains flexible while maintaining consistent safety and quality standards across different projects.

## Amendments and Review

### Contract Maintenance
This contract shall be reviewed quarterly or when significant changes occur to:
- Project architecture or technology stack
- Team composition or processes
- Security requirements or compliance needs
- AI capabilities or limitations

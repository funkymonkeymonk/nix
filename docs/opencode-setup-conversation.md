# opencode Setup Conversation Log

## Overview
This document contains the conversation log from setting up the opencode AI assistant configuration for this Nix repository. The conversation covers the creation of AGENTS.md, communication protocols, safety guidelines, and operational procedures.

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. AGENTS.md Structure
- **Format**: Best-effort agreement rather than legal contract
- **Parties**: Individual developer (Will Weaver) and AI assistant (opencode)
- **Content**: Mutual obligations, concessions, safety guidelines, communication protocols

### 2. Communication Style Preferences
- **Detail Level**: Detailed explanations with reasoning and system-wide context
- **References**: Cite external tools, documentation, and standards
- **Additional Explanation**: Offer to dive deeper on complex topics
- **Formatting**: Structured responses with markdown, code blocks, and clear sections

### 3. Safety Guidelines
- Always review AI-generated code before implementation
- Validate functionality, security, and maintainability
- Use automated tooling (linting, testing, security scanning)
- Never commit secrets or expose sensitive data
- Exercise caution with file operations
- Human oversight for all critical decisions

### 4. Project-Specific Context
- **Taskfile Format**: [Taskfile.dev](https://taskfile.dev/) format in `Taskfile.yml`
- **Nix Ecosystem**: Integration with nix-darwin and home-manager
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [home-manager options](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml)
  - [nix-darwin manual](https://nix-darwin.github.io/nix-darwin/manual/index.html)

### 5. Workflow Integration
- **Primary Use Cases**: Code reviews, debugging configurations, general assistance
- **Task Types**: Nix config changes, debugging, documentation, CI/CD updates
- **Limitations**: No autonomous commits, no processing sensitive data without authorization

### 6. Mutual Concessions
**From opencode:**
- Clear communication with sufficient context
- Regular feedback (positive and negative) for improvement
- Reasonable expectations acknowledging limitations
- Security oversight responsibility
- Resource awareness for computational costs
- Knowledge sharing for project conventions
- Ethical usage within safety boundaries

**From User:**
- Provide clear context and requirements
- Review and validate all AI suggestions
- Offer constructive feedback
- Respect AI limitations
- Maintain security practices

## Implementation Steps

1. **Reviewed README.md** - Updated CI/CD section, development tools, project structure
2. **Examined codebase** - Analyzed flake.nix, Taskfile.yml, CI workflow, devenv.nix
3. **Created AGENTS.md** - Comprehensive agreement covering all aspects
4. **Iterated on contract** - Made it bilateral, focused on individual rather than team
5. **Committed changes** - Added AGENTS.md to repository on opencode-config branch

## Files Modified
- `README.md` - Updated with accurate project information
- `AGENTS.md` - New comprehensive agreement document (203 lines)

## Next Steps
- Review the pull request for the opencode-config branch
- Consider integrating opencode into regular development workflow
- Update AGENTS.md quarterly or when significant changes occur
- Provide feedback to opencode for continuous improvement

## Conversation Summary
This conversation established a collaborative framework for AI-assisted development work, emphasizing mutual respect, clear communication, and rigorous safety practices. The resulting AGENTS.md document serves as both an operational guide and working agreement for responsible AI integration in software development.

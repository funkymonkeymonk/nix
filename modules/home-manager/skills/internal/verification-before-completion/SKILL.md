# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Run verification commands before claiming work is complete.

## When to Use

- Before marking a task done
- Before requesting review
- Before committing changes

## Process

1. **Check requirements** - did you meet all acceptance criteria?
2. **Run tests** - unit, integration, manual
3. **Check for regressions** - did you break anything?
4. **Self-review** - would you approve this PR?
5. **Verify in context** - does it work in the real environment?

## Key Principles

- Never skip verification
- Automate what you can
- Fix issues before submitting
- Document any known limitations

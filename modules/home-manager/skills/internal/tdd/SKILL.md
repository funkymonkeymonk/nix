# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

Test-driven development workflow for implementing features and bugfixes.

## When to Use

- Implementing new features
- Fixing bugs
- Refactoring existing code

## Process (Red-Green-Refactor)

1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing

## Key Principles

- Write tests before implementation
- Keep tests small and focused
- One concept per test
- Refactor only when tests pass
- Run tests frequently

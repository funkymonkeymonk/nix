# Brainstorming

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs through collaborative dialogue.

## When to Use

- Starting a new feature or project
- Unclear on implementation approach
- Need to explore trade-offs

## Process

1. **Understand the idea**: Ask clarifying questions
2. **Explore approaches**: Propose 2-3 options with trade-offs
3. **Present design**: Break into sections, validate incrementally

## Key Principles

- One question at a time
- Prefer multiple choice when possible
- YAGNI ruthlessly
- Present designs in 200-300 word sections
- Be ready to go back and clarify

## After Design

Write validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`

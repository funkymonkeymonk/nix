# Debugging

## Overview

Systematic debugging approach for bugs, test failures, and unexpected behavior.

## When to Use

- Tests failing unexpectedly
- Bug reports without clear cause
- System behaving strangely

## Process

1. **Gather Information**: What changed? When did it start?
2. **Reproduce**: Can you reliably trigger the issue?
3. **Isolate**: Binary search to find the cause
4. **Hypothesize**: Form theories, test them
5. **Verify**: Confirm the fix works

## Key Principles

- Don't guess - use evidence
- Change one thing at a time
- Document what you tried
- Ask for help when stuck
